The smallest, most convenient, typesafe (with TS, but also works with normal JS), event emitter / pubsub system you'll ever need.

Unlike other event emitters, it does not use `on/off/once` methods but only a single subscribe method and returns an unsubscribe handle, which makes it more tiny, easier to type, more convenient to use with arrow functions.

The most minimal code you need for a typesafe pub/sub system, and feature complete, making **suitable to include as a dependency on other libraries**.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save micro-typed-events
// or
yarn add micro-typed-events
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createEvents } from "micro-typed-events";

const numberEvents = createEvents<number>();

const unsubscribe = numberEvents.subscribe(num => console.log(num));

numberEvents.emit(42);
numberEvents.emit("hey"); // Does not compile

unsubscribe();
```
